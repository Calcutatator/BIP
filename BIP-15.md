The Frontinus House Genesis Round has been seen as a monumental shift for the DAO and the Realms Autonomous World. The product market fit shown within the last round was astounding, a quick recap:

On the September the 4th the Genesis grantees were approved and TEN projects granted 100 thousands lords each. The original plan was to 5 grants but after astounding amount of applications, [Ser Palomato](https://twitter.com/palomato3k) pushed forward [BIP-14](https://snapshot.org/#/council.bibliotheca.eth/proposal/0x0b370d6fe380d88be59040676d95353a54204b93eafb57a38f54ec4bb96f00c6) increasing the amount to 10 grantees.

Two areas have been established to showcase the Frontinus House grantees - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/biblio-admin/Frontinus-House-59abea155d2743239cac07f59350a06f) & [Monthly FH Calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpLHW6hvJTg) **Have a look at both!**

The developers building within the Realms Autonomous World has multiplied and with the only one grant the scope of the world we are building has increased too. Card games, Underworlds, session games, game studios - All building within our ecosystem. This was with one single grant from BibliothecaDAO.

### What have we learnt with the Genesis Grant?
-  PMF is here for providing grants within the ecosystem.
-  BibliothecaDAO has garnered a strong ecosystem of world class builders willing to participate.
-  Refinement of the FH grant process is needed:
   - Clear tranche and vesting periods
   - Either clearer and more strategic milestones or smaller grants/no milestones
   - Solidify voting - Last minute rearranging

The are many many teams working on Autonomous Worlds. We are one of the first and should utilise the advantages this gives us.

The conclusion comes to only one thing; We must continue FH rounds but we must refine and adapt in every round although the process may not be perfect, the return and value given to the DAO is a 10x of the value cost.

### Frontinus House

In parallel to the genesis grant the [Frontinus House](https://frontinus.house/) site and process has been completed. This will soon be moved to a fully onchain process leveraging both Starknet and Ethereum L1. This will be an innovative approach and "world" first in the crypto ecosystem.

All rounds within the DAO plan to leverage this system and including this proposal.


# BIP-15 - Frontinus House Proposal 2 (Frontinus Expansion pt I)
The Frontinus House process is a funding mechanism which utilises DAO assets to attract talented builders and to incentivise building within BibliothecaDAO and its current ecosystem.

This current proposal aims are :
-  Expand upon the FH system and builder ecosystem
-  Push for building within the Realms World Contract specifically
-  Lock in builders within the ecosystem to synergise with Bibliotheca DAO
-  Create, remix and build upon current Eternum contracts
-  Create, remix and build upon current Loot Survivor contracts
-  Promote the Realms Autonomous World

The proposal will align with the [Frontinus House Charter](https://github.com/Calcutatator/Frontinus-House-Docs/blob/main/Charter/Charter.md) and follow an the [Frontinus House](Frontinus.house) process. See [user docs](https://docs.metaforo.io/frontinushouse-user-manual).

## Outline of the Round
This round aims to push building within the foundational contracts of the Realms Autonomous World. Eternum builders are currently developing an SDK and Loot Survivor contracts have been crafted with itent to allow building and expanding upon.

The are no restrictions as to who can propose within this round, All submissions are welcome!

The BibliothecaDAO community has compiled several examples of ideas that could be built:
-  Eternum Based examples:
   - Casino within the Realms Autonomous World
   - Trading waypoint
   - Resource p2d based game
   - Frontend for economics
   - Battle simulator
   - P2d game within the world
   - Create a new simplified frontend
-  Loot Survior Based examples:
   - Create a new UI
   - Battle simulator
   - Create new game mechanics
   - Import new components
   - Build a new game using the LS contracts

Please do not see these as requirements, but prompts as to what can be built.

All submissions to this round will utilise [Frontinus House](https://frontinus.house/) and its standard process. Prior to submission please read [Frontinus House Charter](https://github.com/Calcutatator/Frontinus-House-Docs/blob/main/Charter/Charter.md).

## Costs
Up to **1,000,000 LORDS** tokens have been reserved for allocation to builders over the **2 week** duration of the round. 
  *This will be distributed in tweynt grants of 50,000 LORDS each*

50,000 is the maximum amount per grant, but you are of course welcome to submit smaller proposals for less than 50,000 LORDS. Any LORDS that have not been allocated to a grant will be returned to BibliothecaDAO.

All costs will be allocated directly to the BibliothecaDAO Treasury. 

## Execution
The Frontinus House process has several stages to completion. Beginning on 24 October 2023 the process will begin as follows:
-  **1 weeks** proposal period for builders to apply for grants.
-  **1 week** voting period for delegates to decide on which grantees get funded.

This means the round will be completed on approximately **7 November 2023**, and at this point 50% of the funds will be vested over **3** months to the accepted builders.

Please reach out in the Bibliotheca DAO Discord with any questions, and we're excited to see what you build!
