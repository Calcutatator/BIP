The Frontinus House Genesis Round has been seen as a monumental shift for the DAO and the Realms Autonomous World. The product market fit shown within the last round was astounding, a quick recap:

On the September the 4th the Genesis grantees were approved and TEN projects granted 100 thousands lords each. The original plan was to 5 grants but after astounding amount of applications, 24 high quality applications [Ser Palomato](https://twitter.com/palomato3k) pushed forward [BIP-14](https://snapshot.org/#/council.bibliotheca.eth/proposal/0x0b370d6fe380d88be59040676d95353a54204b93eafb57a38f54ec4bb96f00c6) increasing the amount to 10 grantees.

Two areas have been established to showcase the Frontinus House grantees - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/biblio-admin/Frontinus-House-59abea155d2743239cac07f59350a06f) & [Monthly FH Calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpLHW6hvJTg) **Have a look at both!**

The developers building within the Realms Autonomous World has multiplied and with the only one grant the scope of the world we are building has increased too. Card games, Underworlds, session games, game studios - All building within our ecosystem. This was with one single grant from BibliothecaDAO.

### What have we learnt with the Genesis Grant?
-  PMF is here for providing grants within the ecosystem.
-  BibliothecaDAO has garnered a strong ecosystem of world class builders willing to participate.
-  Refinement of the FH grant process is needed:
   - Clear tranche and vesting periods
   - Either clearer and more strategic milestones or smaller grants/no milestones
   - Solidify voting - Last minute rearranging
The are many many teams working on Autonomous Worlds. We are one of the first and should utilise the advantages this gives us.

The conclusion comes to only one thing; We must continue FH rounds but we must refine and adapt in every round although the process may not be perfect, the return and value given to the DAO is a 10x of the value cost.

### Frontinus House

In parallel to the genesis grant the [Frontinus House](https://frontinus.house/) site and process has been completed. This will soon be moved to a fully onchain process leveraging both Starknet and Ethereum L1. This will be an innovative approach and "world" first in the crypto ecosystem.

All rounds within the DAO plan to leverage this system and including this proposal.


### The beginning of 






The proposal will align with the [Frontinus House Charter](https://github.com/Calcutatator/Frontinus-House-Docs/blob/main/Charter/Charter.md) and follow an amended version of the Frontinus House Process as detailed within the Voting System Amendment subsection.
## Outline of the Round
This round aims to simply invite builders within the Starknet and surrounding ecosystems to build within the Realms Autonomous World. The are no restrictions as to who can propose within this round, and there is no specific theme. All submissions are welcome!


The BibliothecaDAO community has compiled several examples of ideas that could be built:
-  AMM front-end (swap tokens, create markets, add liquidity outside of game UI)
-  POC p2d game built upon Eternum (Integrating Eternum assets)
-  Dashboard of market rates for the exchange of Eternum resources
-  Mod to swap realm Orders with other players, form and dissolve alliances
-  Integrate an ecosystem project onto a Madara L3

Please do not see these as requirements, but prompts as to what could be built.

This round will be intentionally open with few restrictions, each builder **must** fill out the [proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RrimGIyNYauTFixJCd_QaZTEtGp2FsodXkhMt2tH180/edit?usp=sharing) and submit this to the DAO within the timeframes noted under the Execution subsection below.

## Costs
Up to **500,000 LORDS** tokens have been reserved for allocation to builders over the **3 week** duration of the round. 
  *This will be distributed in five grants of 100,000 LORDS each*

100,000 is the maximum amount per grant, but you are of course welcome to submit smaller proposals for less than 100,000 LORDS. Any LORDS that have not been allocated to a grant will be returned to BibliothecaDAO.

## Execution
The Frontinus House process has several stages to completion. Beginning on 10 August 2023 the process will begin as follows:
-  **0 week** the voting period for delegates will be completed.
-  **2 weeks** proposal period for builders to apply for grants.
-  **1 week** voting period for delegates to decide on which grantees get funded.

This means the round will be completed on approximately **31 August 2023**, and at this point 50% of the funds will be vested over **3** months to the accepted builders. On completion of the objectives defined within the proposal, the remaining 50% will be released to builders and vested over a further **3** months.

### Voting System Amendment
The Genesis Round will have an amended voting period process. Instead of an in app voting system, we will use a simple emoji based vote within the Realms x Bibliotheca DAO discord for Realm holders. This will mean each Realm NFT holder will only hold single voting power per proposal. Builders receiving the highest approval ratings will receive the grants.

Approval rating will be calculated as a percentage of total votes on each proposal. Example - 100 votes with 60 for and 40 against will mean a 60% approval rating. 

A proposal must meet these two requirements:
-  A minimum of 50% approval rating (Proposal must get consensus approval)
-  Greater than 20% of votes of the most voted proposal (Proposals will have a reasonable quorum)

Please reach out in the Bibliotheca DAO Discord with any questions, and we're excited to see what you build!
